# How do we communicate about the climate crisis and related challenges to those who choose to deny it?

## Introduction

In contemporary society, public discourse faces significant challenges, particularly regarding the climate crisis and the rhetorical problem of competing facts: the validity of facts and belief in them is often debated based on political identities (Kovaka, 2019). The rise of social media has exacerbated these issues, creating echo chambers where individuals are predominantly exposed to information that reinforces their existing beliefs (Menczer & Hills, 2020). These echo chambers provide our "in-groups", which influence cognitive biases and shape how information is perceived (Menczer & Hills, 2020). In addition to providing a catalyst for confirmation bias, social media platforms amplify the effect of terministic screens—lenses created by words or terms that shape our perceptions (Ratcliffe & Jensen, 2022). This combination of phenomena foster extreme polarization of political beliefs which makes it increasingly difficult for divergent views to coexist within individuals.

Given that people choose what they believe in and listen to based on their in-groups, how do we communicate about the climate crisis and related challenges to those who choose to deny it? By thoroughly understanding our audience, we can employ rhetorical strategies to disentangle and frame our evidence most effectively. Identity and language can be wielded as tools to portray information through a preferred lens, further entrenching division and misunderstanding. Therefore, by recognizing the influence of identity on belief systems and thereby strategically framing our communication to align better with these cultures, we can bridge the divide and foster a more cohesive understanding of the climate crisis. 

The Role of Identity in Belief Systems

Beliefs are inherently social constructs, shaped by the groups to which individuals belong (Hendricks, 2017). The lens through which individuals view data is significantly shaped by their personal and social identities (Ratcliffe & Jensen, 2022). And so, although the raw data concerning climate change remains consistent, its interpretation varies dramatically across different segments of the public (Ratcliffe & Jensen, 2022). In the context of climate change, this results in the competing facts phenomenon. This means that those who are politically liberal believe in climate change and evidence of it, while those who are politically conservative simply deny that it is true. Thus, we uncover a critical characteristic of the psyche of climate change deniers: climate change denial is not merely a matter of ignorance or lack of information. Instead, it is deeply rooted in the cultural and social identities that people cherish. 

Polarization, magnified by echo chambers, further complicates this issue. Factual issues, such as climate change, become entangled in antagonistic cultural meanings, transforming positions on these issues into symbols of loyalty to opposing groups (Kahan, 2015). In this context, acknowledging climate change becomes less about accepting scientific evidence and more about maintaining group cohesion and identity.

## Motivated Reasoning

By understanding the crucial role of group identity in people’s beliefs, we can begin to answer the question: why do people deny climate change despite the exorbitant amount of evidence supporting its validity? Due to people’s predisposition to agree with their political groups and in-groups, they tend to use whatever reasoning it takes to support those group’s beliefs. A subset of motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, leads individuals to favor information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs and dismiss information that contradicts them (Racliffe & Jensen, 2022). Through motivated reasoning, individuals arrive at conclusions they desire, often by cherry-picking data that supports their pre-existing beliefs (Kovaka, 2019). For example, climate change deniers may use the lack of short term visible environmental changes as evidence against climate change, while ignoring the plethora of scientific research suggesting otherwise. And when they do consider research, Ratcliffe and Jensen's work on confirmation bias shows that this cognitive bias is pervasive and can distort the interpretation of scientific evidence.

In fact, the influence of identity on belief systems is particularly evident when examining the stance of some scientists on climate change. In their works, Kovaka, Kahan and Hendricks all highlight instances where scientists reject climate change due to their political affiliations. This rejection is not necessarily a repudiation of scientific evidence but a reflection of the broader cultural and political identities these individuals align with. Feelings of betrayal can lead individuals to reject evidence that contradicts their group's stance, as accepting it would mean betraying their social identity (Kovaka, 2019). Thus, it is evident that having high scientific literacy does not make you more likely to agree with science, but rather have improved motivated reasoning skills.

Among the variety of logic tactics that climate change deniers employ to support their beliefs, some deniers question the standards of science itself. Individuals might use the nature of scientific inquiry, which involves uncertainty and ongoing revision, as a reason to dismiss climate change evidence (Kovaka, 2019). This skepticism towards the scientific process further entrenches their denial, as it provides a rationale for ignoring inconvenient truths.

## Crafting An Effective Argument

To effectively communicate the urgency of climate change to deniers, it is crucial to understand the audience and anticipate their reactions. The challenge of communicating the climate crisis to deniers necessitates the use of sophisticated rhetorical strategies. Rhetorical tactics must be carefully constructed to address the specific rhetorical problem at hand (Ratcliffe & Jensen, 2022). In this case, the problem is the deep-seated skepticism and denial of climate change, often driven by identity and motivated reasoning. By understanding the audience and anticipating their reactions, we can develop strategies that effectively communicate scientific evidence.

However, motivated reasoning may just be the logical side of the public’s perspective. To effectively craft an argument, we must also understand how they may emotionally react to information. The Public Irrationality Thesis (PIT) asserts that the general public often lacks the scientific literacy necessary to evaluate information critically (Kahan, 2015). Instead, people rely on intuitive and emotional judgments. This cognitive tendency means that immediate and visceral threats, such as terrorism, are often overestimated, while more abstract and distant threats like climate change are underestimated (Kahan, 2015). This discrepancy arises because people measure threats based on personal relevance and emotional impact rather than empirical data.

Anticipating these reactions involves acknowledging the emotional and intuitive ways in which people process information. Effective communication strategies should therefore address these cognitive biases by making climate change personally relevant and emotionally engaging. This can be achieved through storytelling, relatable examples, and by framing the issue in ways that align with the audience’s values and concerns.

## Aligning Perspectives and Framing

A powerful rhetorical strategy that can make climate change more relatable to certain audiences is time-framing. Research by Kovaka highlights that conservatives are more responsive to climate change messages framed in terms of restoring the past rather than saving the future. This approach leverages the nostalgia and value placed on preserving heritage and traditions. For example, when shown an image of a healthy river labeled as "past" and a dried-up river labeled as "present," conservatives are more likely to support climate action compared to when the same images are labeled as "present" and "future." This technique works because it frames environmental degradation as a loss of something cherished, rather than a distant or uncertain future threat. Time-framing operates as a form of terministic screening, as mentioned earlier, which refers to the way language directs attention to certain aspects of reality while neglecting others. By framing climate action as a means to restore a valued past, communicators can align the message with conservative values, making it more persuasive.

Another powerful form tactic is to shift the perspective of evidence to align with one's social group identity. This approach involves presenting scientific evidence in ways that resonate with the audience's existing values and identities that do not directly tie to their political ones. This is an effective approach to communicating climate crisis information since it avoids political identity and thereby prevents the viewer’s predisposed tendency to agree with their political identity. This strategy recognizes that people's beliefs are often influenced by their social affiliations and the desire to maintain group cohesion. For instance, discussing the impacts of climate change in terms of fishing, a culturally significant activity for many communities, can make the issue more relatable (Kovaka, 2019). Furthermore, by framing climate change in terms of its effects on something deeply valued by the community, communicators can create a stronger emotional connection to the issue.

The idea of presenting climate change information in a way that does not conflict with an individual's core commitments is called disentanglement , which separates the acquisition of information from the obligation to uphold one's political identity (Kahan, 2015). This strategy helps dissolve the perceived conflict between acknowledging human-caused global warming and expressing one's cultural identity. This approach reduces the cognitive dissonance between accepting scientific evidence and maintaining one's social identity.

Effective communication also involves fostering a sense of unity rather than division. Emphasizing a win-win perspective is crucial for fostering understanding and empathy, which can lead to changing minds. Ratcliffe and Jensen explain that rhetorical listening is the act of opening your mind to other perspectives in order to bypass rhetorical problems, such as climate change. By presenting climate change in a way that transcends political identities, we can avoid the "win-lose" mentality, which causes most deniers to become defensive and agree with their political groups. By employing the previously mentioned rhetorical strategies, we can enable our audience to engage in "rhetorical listening," even if they are not consciously aware of it. This approach is essential because it mitigates the feelings of identity betrayal that often prevent climate change deniers from accepting the evidence.

## Conclusion

The challenge of communicating the climate crisis to deniers is not merely a battle over facts and figures; it is a profound exploration of human identity, social belonging, and cognitive biases. The journey to effective communication requires us to move beyond the simplistic notion that more data will change minds. Instead, it demands a deep empathy for the ways in which people construct their realities and a strategic approach that respects these psychological and cultural frameworks.

The insights from Ratcliffe and Jensen, Hendricks, Kovaka, and Kahan illuminate the path forward: recognizing the power of identity, the nuanced role of scientific knowledge, and the pervasive influence of motivated reasoning. These elements are not barriers to be overcome, but keys to unlocking more effective and compassionate communication strategies.

The solution lies in disentangling the evidence from polarizing narratives and framing it in a way that aligns with the audience's core values. This approach involves empathy, cultural sensitivity, and strategic communication. By presenting climate action as a collective endeavor that reinforces, rather than challenges, social identities, we can foster a sense of unity and common purpose. By doing so, we can bridge the divide, fostering a broader consensus and mobilizing collective action to address one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The climate crisis demands urgent attention, and through thoughtful, identity-aware communication, we can inspire meaningful change and ensure a sustainable future.
